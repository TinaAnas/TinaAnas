# 🙋‍♂️ About me
A brief about Anas, the trainer and the aspiring data engineer!

# 🔭 I'm currently working on
1. Translating **Mr. Joe Reis’s upcoming book *Practical Data Modeling (PDM)*** into Arabic, making its ideas accessible to a wider audience.  
   My work is published through a free Substack newsletter, and I’d be delighted to welcome Arabic speakers to join. If you know someone interested in this field, please feel free to share it with them.\
2. Teaching the **"Database Design and SQL Queries"** module at the Faculty of IT Engineering (FITE), Damascus University.
3. Delivering **"Programming Basics with Python"** courses for students with or without prior programming experience — both online and in-person here in Damascus, Syria.
 
# 🧠 I’m currently learning
Data Engineering, Practically.

# 🌱 How to support me
1. Many students in Syria struggle with English-only resources, so I often create simplified Arabic content by gathering and adapting material from diverse sources. Aligning training with real-world job market needs requires a lot of time and effort. If you have training materials (courses, learning resources, etc.) that bridge theory and practical, job-ready skills, I’d love to build on them. I can take care of translating, localizing, and simplifying the content into Arabic, and deliver it effectively to learners.
2. By subscribing to my Substack newsletter and/or my YouTube channel (links above).
3. I also collect and translate content from English into Arabic for those interested in collaboration. If you have a book or other material you’d like to make accessible to Arabic speakers, I’d be happy to work with you.
